Start by opening the file README/Workshop.md.pdf.

Note that this was created by clicking the print button from the markdown file Workshop.md, 
which you can also open if you want to see how it was created.

If you want to click on any of the links that take you to other webpages, 
you might want to click in such a way that a new browser tab is opened 
(e.g. right click and select this from the menu) 
so your SageMathCloud tabs are preserved.
